- **AI Integration**: Seamlessly integrate with popular AI frameworks like OpenAI, Cohere, and Anthropic.
- **Data Analysis**: Leverage built-in tools for analyzing and visualizing data.
- **Jupyter Notebook Support**: Run your code in Jupyter Notebooks for an interactive coding experience.

## Getting Started

To get started with Super Robot, follow the steps below to set up your environment and install the SDKs.

### Installation

You can download the latest version of Super Robot from the [Releases](https://github.com/techsysditsolution/super-robot/releases) section. Follow the instructions for your specific SDK:

1. **Python SDK**:
   - Use pip to install the SDK:
     ```bash
     pip install super-robot-python
     ```

2. **JavaScript/TypeScript SDK**:
   - Use npm to install the SDK:
     ```bash
     npm install super-robot-js
     ```

### Usage

Once you have installed the SDKs, you can start using them in your projects. Hereâ€™s a quick example to illustrate how to execute code using the Python SDK:

```python
from super_robot import CodeExecutor

executor = CodeExecutor()
result = executor.execute("print('Hello, Super Robot!')")
print(result)
```

For the JavaScript/TypeScript SDK, you can use the following code:

```javascript
const { CodeExecutor } = require('super-robot-js');

const executor = new CodeExecutor();
executor.execute("console.log('Hello, Super Robot!')");
```

## SDKs Overview

### Python SDK

The Python SDK allows you to easily execute Python code snippets and interact with various AI models. It provides a simple interface for executing code and retrieving results.

#### Features of Python SDK

- Execute Python code snippets.
- Integrate with OpenAI and other AI services.
- Perform data analysis and visualization.

### JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

The JavaScript/TypeScript SDK provides similar functionality for web applications. It allows developers to run JavaScript code snippets and integrate AI capabilities directly into their applications.

#### Features of JavaScript/TypeScript SDK

- Execute JavaScript code snippets.
- Easy integration with web frameworks.
- Support for TypeScript for type safety.

## Examples

Here are some practical examples of how to use the SDKs in your applications.

### Python Example: Data Analysis

```python
import pandas as pd
from super_robot import CodeExecutor

# Load some data
data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')

# Execute a data analysis code snippet
executor = CodeExecutor()
analysis_code = """
import pandas as pd
df = pd.DataFrame(data)
result = df.describe()
"""
result = executor.execute(analysis_code)
print(result)
```

### JavaScript Example: Web Application

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const { CodeExecutor } = require('super-robot-js');

const app = express();
const executor = new CodeExecutor();

app.get('/execute', (req, res) => {
    const code = req.query.code;
    executor.execute(code).then(result => {
        res.send(result);
    });
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
    console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
});
```
